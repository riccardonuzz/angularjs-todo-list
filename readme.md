# Angular.js Todo List

Yes, another one. Another "todo list" project here. I use to always make small projects when learning new technologies.

This time I tried to make Angular.js work with TypeScript and Webpack. Not an hard challange cause looks like the old beloved Angular.js already had some typings.

I have to admit it: Angular.js + TypeScript is very similar to Angular. Same concepts, same component structure and many others.

## Run this project

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```
